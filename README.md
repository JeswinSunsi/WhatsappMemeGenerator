# Whatsapp Meme Generator Bot
A simple meme generator bot for Whatsapp.

## Disclaimer
This bot has bugs, tons of bugs. I only wanted to learn some quick fundamentals of Twilio. The Whatsapp api publishing use-cases do not allow for bots, this bot is to be run in a whsatsapp sandob (Twilio).

## The Stack
Powered by the Twilio whatsapp api, server hosted on repl.it, uptimerobot pings it every 55 minutes, meme generated by a serverless function from memegen.link

## How to make it work
Make an account at Twilio.com, start a programmable messaging app for whatsapp, set the webhook to your server (with /incoming as the route. You can change this from ther server file) Do not forget to add your Auth and Sid from twilio into your .env file (ACCOUNTSID and AUTHTOKEN)

## The syntax to making memes
Send a text message to the bot in the format `top caption#bottom caption#image link`. The `#` is the seperator. For example, https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aKDR333_460s.jpg can be replicated by sending 
```

```

## The whys
Just wanted to learn making some twilio apps, also cuz it's fun.
